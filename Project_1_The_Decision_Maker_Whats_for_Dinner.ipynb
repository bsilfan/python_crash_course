It's a whole lot easier to run doctests than to continually type in answers to series of questions, so I recommend bringing in the tests early for faster development and debugging."

This would probably involve `if` statements in the `input()` part of the program as well as nested `if` statements inside `calculate_score` itself. You could even use default arguments in your `calculate_score` function if that makes the code cleaner.\n",
        "* **Error checking**: What if you ask a user a yes/no question and they answer \"maybe\"? Or if you ask them for a numeric answer but they write a word or type a \"$\" in front? You can do some error checking after receiving each answer to make sure it is compatible with what `calculate_score` expects, and if not, you can try to convert it into an appropriate response or ask the user a follow-up question to clarify.\n",
        "* **Personality quiz**: Ever taken one of those silly quizzes in magazines or online, like \"What LOTR character are you?\". They ask a bunch of questions and then declare which character you're the most like. You can use a very similar approach to this project to make a quiz like that. That'd be pretty different from the original project though, so make a copy of your original notebook if you go down that path!"
